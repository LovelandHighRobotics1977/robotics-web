                We compete in the annual FIRST Robotics competition each Spring at Denver University. Starting from scratch, 
                each year we brainstorm and collaborate to create a robot in six weeks to compete. Aside from competing, we also 
                host a summer camp to provide younger students with an opportunity to build and run through the design process 
                similar to our team for competition.

                "The Loveland Robotics team is efficient, proficient, sufficient, 
                omniscient and hard-working. When I joined the robotics team as a young man (oh, it seemed to be a lifetime ago),
                I saw the promise and dedication in the faces and work-ethic of these individuals known to me now as my peers."
